# Solargraph ARC

## Solargraph-arc [was merged](https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails/pull/29) in [solargraph-rails](https://github.com/iftheshoefritz/solargraph-rails). Please use that repo for issues/PR.

[Solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) **A**wesome **R**ails **C**ompletions

## Features

- fixes autocompletion for multi-level classes defined in 1 line `class Foo::Bar::Baz`. See https://github.com/castwide/solargraph/issues/506
- autocomplete database columns by parsing db/schema.rb
- autocomplete of model relations
- parsing of `delegate` calls
- completions for methods generated by Devise (`current_user`, `sign_in_and_redirect`, etc)
- better support for running solargraph outside bundle
- better completion inside controllers. `request`, `response`, `params`, etc.
- autocomplete inside routes.rb
- autocomplete inside migrations
- completions for methods generated by ActiveStorage
- better ActiveRecord completions

Still, due to dynamic nature of some Rails code, not all completion candidates are returned. Things get worse when you chain methods.
Without type information, Solargraph cannot deduce the object you are calling methods on.

## Supported Ruby/Rails versions

This gem currently supports:
- Ruby 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7. Ruby 3.0 [almost](https://github.com/alisnic/solargraph-arc/issues/16) works
- Rails 5 and Rails 6

## Usage

1. Install gem and [make sure your editor is integrated with solargraph](https://solargraph.org/)

    ```
    gem install solargraph-arc
    ```

2. If you project does not have a solagraph config, generate one using `solargraph config`
2. update your project `.solargraph.yml`:

    ```yml
    # ...
    plugins:
      - solargraph-arc
    ```
2. if you use solargraph from bundle, don't forget to include `solagraph-arc` in your Gemfile
2. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure yard documentation is built for your project (solargraph uses it for completions)
Execute this in your project root:

    ```
    $ yard gems
    ```

    otherwise a lot of completions won't work

## Troubleshooting

See https://solargraph.org/guides/troubleshooting

## Contributing

1. create fork and clone the repo
2. install gem deps `bundle install`
3. install dummy rails5 app deps and build its yard cache

    ```
    $ cd spec/rails5
    $ bundle install && yard gems
    $ cd ../../
    ```

3. install dummy rails6 app deps and build its yard cache

    ```
    $ cd spec/rails6
    $ bundle install && yard gems
    $ cd ../../
    ```
4. now tests should pass locally and you can try different changes
